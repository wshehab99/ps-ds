In this challenge, 
the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

Python supports a useful concept of default argument values. 
For each keyword argument of a function, w
e can assign a default value which is going to be used as the value of said argument if the function is called without it. 
For example, consider the following increment function:
    def increment_by(n, increment=1):
        return n + increment

Debug the given function print_from_stream using the default value of one of its arguments.

This function should print the first n values returned by get_next() method of stream object provided as an argument. 
Each of these values should be printed in a separate line.
Whenever the function is called without the stream argument, it should use an instance of EvenStream class defined in the code stubs below as the value of stream.
