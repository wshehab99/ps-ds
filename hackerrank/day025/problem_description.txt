The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python.
It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, 
and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.


In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, m and n. There are n words, which might repeat, in word group A.
There are m words belonging to word group B.
For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not.Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.
