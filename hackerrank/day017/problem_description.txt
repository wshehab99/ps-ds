Consider the following:
A string, s, of length n where s = c0c1.....cn-1.
An integer, k, where k is a factor of n.
We can split s into n/k subsegments where each subsegment, ti, consists of a contiguous block of k characters in s. Then, use each ti to create string ui such that:
The characters in ui are a subsequence of the characters in ti.
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in ui occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index j in ti occurs at a previous index<j in ti, then do not include the character in string ui.
Given s and k, print n/k lines where each line i denotes string ui.
