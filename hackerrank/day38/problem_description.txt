Concept

If the inputs are given on one line separated by a character (the delimiter), use split() to get the separate values in the form of a list. The delimiter is space (ascii 32) by default. To specify that comma is the delimiter, use string.split(','). For this challenge, and in general on HackerRank, space will be the delimiter.

If the list values are all integer types, use the map() method to convert all the strings to integers.

Sets are an unordered collection of unique values. A single set contains values of any immutable data type.

MODIFYING SETS

Using the add() function:
Using the update() function:
# update() only works for iterable objects

REMOVING ITEMS :

Both the discard() and remove() functions take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present, discard() does nothing, but remove() will raise a KeyError exception.

COMMON SET OPERATIONS Using union(), intersection() and difference() functions.
The union() and intersection() functions are symmetric methods:


Task
Given 2 sets of integers, M and N,print their symmetric difference in ascending order.
The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.
