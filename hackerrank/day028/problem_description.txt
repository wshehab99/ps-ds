mean

The mean tool computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.
By default, the axis is None. Therefore, it computes the mean of the flattened array.

var

The var tool computes the arithmetic variance along the specified axis.
By default, the axis is None. Therefore, it computes the variance of the flattened array.

std

The std tool computes the arithmetic standard deviation along the specified axis.
By default, the axis is None. Therefore, it computes the standard deviation of the flattened array.

Task

You are given a 2-D array of size NXM.
Your task is to find:

The mean along axis 1
The var along axis 0
The std along axis None
