itertools.permutations(iterable[, r])

This tool returns successive r length permutations of elements in an iterable.

If r is not specified or is None, then r defaults to the length of the iterable, and all possible full length permutations are generated.

Permutations are printed in a lexicographic sorted order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the permutation tuples will be produced in a sorted order.

Task

You are given a string S.
Your task is to print all possible permutations of size k of the string in lexicographic sorted order.
