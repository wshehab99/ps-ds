Exceptions
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.

Examples:

ZeroDivisionError
This error is raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.

ValueError
This error is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.


Handling Exceptions
The statements try and except can be used to handle selected exceptions. A try statement may have more than one except clause to specify handlers for different exceptions.
Output
