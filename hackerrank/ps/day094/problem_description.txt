The NumPy (Numeric Python) package helps us manipulate large arrays and matrices of numeric data.

To use the NumPy module, we need to import it using:

    import numpy

Arrays

A NumPy array is a grid of values. They are similar to lists, except that every element of an array must be the same type.


Task

You are given a space separated list of numbers.
Your task is to print a reversed NumPy array with the element type float.
