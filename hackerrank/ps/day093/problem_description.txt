Basic mathematical functions operate element-wise on arrays. 
They are available both as operator overloads and as functions in the NumPy module.

Task

You are given two integer arrays, A and B of dimensions N X M.
Your task is to perform the following operations:

Add (A + B)
Subtract (A - B)
Multiply (A * B)
Integer Division (A / B)
Mod (A % B)
Power (A ** B)


Note
There is a method numpy.floor_divide() that works like numpy.divide() except it performs a floor division.
