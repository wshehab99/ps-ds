You are given four points A, B, C and D in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
You are required to print the angle between the plane made by the points ABC and BCD in degrees(not radians). 
Let the angle be PHI.
Cos(PHI) = (X.Y)/|X||Y| where X=AB*BC and Y=BC*CD
Here,X.Y  means the dot product of X and Y, and A x B means the cross product of vectors AB and BC. Also,AB= B - A .

Input Format

One line of input containing the space separated floating number values of the X,Y and Z coordinates of a point.


Output Format

Output the angle correct up to two decimal places.
