Transpose

We can generate the transposition of an array using the tool numpy.transpose.
It will not affect the original array, but it will create a new array.

Flatten

The tool flatten creates a copy of the input array flattened to one dimension.


Task

You are given a N X M integer array matrix with space separated elements (N = rows and  M = columns).
Your task is to print the transpose and flatten results.
