max

The tool max returns the maximum value along a given axis.
By default, the axis value is None. Therefore, it finds the maximum over all the dimensions of the input array.


Task

You are given a 2-D array with dimensions N X M.
Your task is to perform the min function over axis 1 and then find the max of that.
