The NumPy module also comes with a number of built-in routines for linear algebra calculations. These can be found in the sub-module linalg.

linalg.det

The linalg.det tool computes the determinant of an array.


linalg.eig

The linalg.eig computes the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array.


linalg.inv

The linalg.inv tool computes the (multiplicative) inverse of a matrix.


Task

You are given a square matrix A with dimensions N X N. 
Your task is to find the determinant. Note: Round the answer to 2 places after the decimal.
